// Variables
//    A "named storage" for data. Used to store various types of data.

// A variable can be declared using the syntax below. Each keyword has a different purpose.

var variable; // old-school way to declare a variable.
let data; // Essentially the newer equivalent of 'var'. 
const constant = 0;  //const: a declaration in which the assigned value never changes after this first assignment. 
                    // Usually near the top of the JS file. Naming convention is all capital-case and underscores, 'VARIABLE_NAME'.
                    // NOTE: a const variable whose value is calculated in run-time (during execution) is named normally: 'varableName'.
